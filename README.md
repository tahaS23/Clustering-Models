1. Home insurance quote conversion
```
Homesite, A leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not have a dynamic conversion rate model 
that can give them confidence that a quoted price will lead to a purchase. 
Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and 
coverage information, I created a model to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. This 
prediction would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain 
an ideal portfolio of customer segments.
