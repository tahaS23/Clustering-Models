# Clustering Models 

This repository contains a portfolio of clustering projects completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes. The work is presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

1. Home insurance quote conversion
```
Homesite, A leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not have a dynamic conversion rate model 
that can give them confidence that a quoted price will lead to a purchase. 
Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and 
coverage information, I created a model to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. The 
prediction results would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and 
maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments.

2. Identifying products with similar time series

3. Clustering of products based on annual spending figures 
```
**Problem Statement**
The annual spending figures of customers of a wholesaler in Portugal that operates in different regions 
are provided. The products sold by the wholeseller are: fresh produce, milk products, grocery, frozen 
products, detergents, paper, and delicatessen. It has two groups of customers or channels, Horeca
(hotels/restaurants/cafes) and retail. It services three regions (Lisbon, Oporto and other). The annual 
spending figures are provided for each product type for each region and channel combination.

**Analysis Conducted**
Performed K-means clustering on the basis of annual spending on different product types and then related those cluster characteristics to the annual spending figures based on region and channel.
